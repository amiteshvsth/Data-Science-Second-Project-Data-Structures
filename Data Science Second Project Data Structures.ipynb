    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are one of the most versatile and commonly used data structures in Python. Here are the key features of lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordered: Lists maintain the order of elements. The elements have a specific order, and this order will not change unless explicitly modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable: Lists can be changed after their creation. You can add, remove, or change elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic: Lists can grow and shrink as needed. You can add or remove elements at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneous: Lists can contain elements of different data types. You can mix integers, strings, objects, and other lists within a single list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexable: You can access elements in a list using their index. Python uses zero-based indexing, so the first element has an index of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing: Like strings, you can slice lists to access a subset of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various Methods: Lists come with many built-in methods for easy manipulation, such as append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), pop(), clear(), index(), count(), sort(), \n",

    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples and lists are both sequence data types in Python that can store a collection of items. However, they have several key differences that affect how and when you might use each.\n",
    "Here’s a comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mutability\n",

    "my_list[0] = 10\n",

    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "# my_tuple[0] = 10  # This will raise a TypeError\n",

    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable. This immutability requirement is crucial for maintaining the integrity and performance of dictionaries. \n",
    "Here’s why immutable keys are important, along with examples to illustrate these concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of Immutable Dictionary Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashability:\n",
    "Dictionary keys must be hashable, meaning they must have a fixed hash value that remains the same during their lifetime.\n",
    "Immutable types like strings, numbers, and tuples (containing only immutable elements) are hashable and can be used as dictionary keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency:\n",
    "If dictionary keys were mutable, their hash value could change, causing inconsistencies in key lookups and making it impossible to reliably retrieve stored values.\n",
    "Example: If a list were used as a key, and the list’s content changed, the dictionary would lose track of the original key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance:\n",
    "Hash tables, the underlying data structure for dictionaries, rely on quick lookups, insertions, and deletions based on consistent hash values.\n",
    "Immutable keys ensure that hash values remain constant, allowing efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Immutable Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Strings as Keys:\n",
    "my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n",
    "print(my_dict[\"name\"])  # Output: Alice\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Numbers as Keys:\n",
    "my_dict = {1: \"one\", 2: \"two\", 3: \"three\"}\n",
    "print(my_dict[2])  # Output: two\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Tuples as Keys:\n",
    "my_dict = {(1, 2): \"a pair\", (3, 4): \"another pair\"}\n",
    "print(my_dict[(1, 2)])  # Output: a pair\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Mutable Keys Causing Issues\n",
    "Using a List as a Key (Raises TypeError):\n",
    "my_dict = {}\n",
    "key = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "# my_dict[key] = \"a list\"  # Raises TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Mutable Keys Leading to Inconsistencies:\n",
    "my_dict = {}\n",
    "key = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "my_dict[key] = \"a tuple\"\n",
    "key = (1, 2, 4)  # Changing the key would lead to loss of original key\n",
    "# print(my_dict[key])  # Raises KeyError\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Complex Keys\n",
    "If you need to use a mutable type as a key, you can convert it to an immutable type (like a tuple) before using it as a dictionary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting List to Tuple for Key:\n",

    "print(my_dict)  # Output: {frozenset({1, 2, 3}): 'a frozenset'}\n",

    "Summary\n",
    "Hashability and Consistency: Immutable keys are necessary to ensure the hash values remain constant, allowing for consistent and efficient dictionary operations.\n",
    "Performance: Immutable keys support the performance characteristics of hash tables, enabling quick lookups, insertions, and deletions.\n",
